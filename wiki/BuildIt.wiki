#summary Parts list and assembly instructions

= Introduction =

This shield should fit any of the Arduino boards or clones. It has been tested with the "Duemilanove", which is a handy choice since it has a built-in USB connector for data logging.  You can find the Arduino and its clones many places, including [http://www.moderndevice.com Modern Devices] and [http://www.sparkfun.com Sparkfun].  Typical cost is around $30.

= Details =

  * 4-channel ADC chip: MCP3424 I2C
  * ambient temperature sensor MCP9800
  * 2 outputs for driving SSR

*Notes*
  # You may prefer the 'stackable' headers, for example Sparkfun PRT-09280 and PRT-09279
  # Or you could buy a 36-pin and cut apart to make your own.
  # 2N2222 or other NPN might work just as well
  # probably available locally at Radio Shack, etc.
