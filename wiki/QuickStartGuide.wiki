Quick Start Guide for software setup and first test of tc4-shield

= Introduction =

  # download software
  # 'burn' the program into the Arduino board
  # run the PC real-time graphical display and logging program



= Details =

  # download and install "Processing.Org" software
      * follow the instructions here: [http://processing.org/download/]
      * you most likely should choose 'Windows' rather than 'without Java'
  # download and install "Arduino IDE" software
      * follow the instructions here: [http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software]
      * try the 'Blink' example (do not attach your tc4-shield yet)
      * make sure you can get the 'Blink' example working before you proceed
  # download tc4-shield zip file
      * unzip the tc4-shield files
      * library folders (with files) for arduino programs should be copied into C:/Program Files/arduino-0018/libraries (or wherever your Arduino executables are installed).  The Arduino IDE reads the libraries folder on startup, so you will need to exit the IDE and then restart before it will know about a new library.
      * both Processing and Arduino sketches must be located in a folder whose name matches the name of the sketch (i.e. the .pde file).
  # Unplug the USB cable, install the tc4-shield
  # Plug in USB cable, confirm 'Blink' still works
  # 'burn' the demo1 sketch into the Arduino
  # bring up the 'Serial Monitor' in the Arduino IDE, 57600 baud.
  # verify that sketch is running, should say 'mcp9800 config OK'
  # Close Serial Monitor and Arduino IDE
  # Run the Processing IDE, select the Logger sketch and run it
  # FIXME: more to come
