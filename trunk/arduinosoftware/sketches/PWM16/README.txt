PWM16.pde
---------

Demo program for the 16-bit PWM library.

Connect LED's to Arduion digital pins 9 and 10.  Current
limiting resistors should not be required since
the Arduino limits the output current to 20mA on
the digital pins.

This demo program will fade the LED's in and out.  The
LED's will be out of phase with one another.
