aj_logger.pde
-------------

This program has its roots in the ADCdvlp sketch.  But since I am changing the
ADCdvlp code frequently to try out new things, I thought it might be useful
to have a relatively static sketch (this one) for supporting the pj_logger
Processing program.

This program differs slightly from Bill Welch's a_logger sketch in that the
a_logger sketch uses a different linearization model for converting mV readings
into thermocouple temperatures.

At some point we will merge the two source codes, at which point aj_logger will
probably be mothballed.
